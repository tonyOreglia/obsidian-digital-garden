      <main><h1>Connection between psychology and morality</h1>
<p>morality and psychology are deeply connected</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider that a large portion of people will steal if a) it&#39;s easy and b) it&#39;s low risk. Consider also the consistency principle which tends to make stealing habitual. It follows that, if you run a business that makes stealing easy, you are perpetrating a moral injustice against the employees.</li>
<li>consider workers compensation for stress in California. Although the stress is real, the solution is impossible to police. It encourages crooked lawyers, doctors, unions, etc. Overall, it would be better to let some things go uncompensated â€“ to let life be hard.</li>
