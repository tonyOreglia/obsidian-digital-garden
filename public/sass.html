      <main><h1>SASS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sass uses variables<ul>
<li>In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name. For example:```
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}</p>
<pre><code>* Sass allows nesting of CSS rules
* a *mixin* is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet. It works like a function, accepting values as parameters
    * A mixin is called with the `@include` directive
* The `@if` directive in Sass is useful to test for a specific case
    * `@else if` and `@else` also work
* `@for` also works
* the `@each` directive which loops over each item in a list or map, for example:```
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>@while</code> is also supported</li>
<li><em>Partials</em> in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code<ul>
<li>Names for partials start with an underscore (<code>_</code>)</li>
<li>To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the @import directive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>extend</code> enables borrowing the CSS rules from one element and build upon them in another</li>
</ul>
