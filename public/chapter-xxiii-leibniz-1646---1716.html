      <main><h1>Chapter XXIII: Leibniz (1646 - 1716)</h1>
<h1>Character and Personality</h1>
<p>Born in Germany, soon after the 30 years war, <a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a> grew up wealthy with good education. He was a polymath and entered university at the early age of 15. He was outwardly faithful to Chirstiantiy. Leibniz was not well liked apparently, as only a single person attended his funeral.</p>
<h1>Method</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="leibniz.html">Leibniz</a> was a prolific writer, writing about 300 letters per year. He had a tendency to want to unify and find compromise, as he attempted between Protestants and Catholics, and between philosophers with a unified language of philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Main Insights and Works</h1>

<li><a href="monads.html">monads</a> : a fundamental unit of the universe of which everything is made. Every monad has a life force and a will to exist governed by the laws of motion. Every monad is unique, each is subject to the influence of the rest of the universe making it a low resolution mirror of everything.</li>

<li><a href="thodice.html">Théodicée</a>: a justification for God. Suffering and the fall of Adam/Eve is necessary for man&#39;s free will. Good and evil are subjective. This is the best of all possible worlds.</li>

</blockquote>
<h1>Other</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>the 17th century was one of the most productive in the history of thought. Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Bayle, Leibniz: here was a majestic sequence of men warm with the wine of reason, joyfully confident ... that they could understand the universe</p>

<ul>
<li>the 17th centure laid the foundations for modern thought; as it was rational and forward thinking, adventuring into unknown territory</li>
