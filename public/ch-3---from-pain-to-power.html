      <main><h1>ch 3 - From Pain to Power</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the real issue has nothing to do with the fear itself, but, rather, how we <em>hold</em> the fear. For some, the fear is totally irrelevant. For others, it creates a state of paralysis. The former hold their fear from a position of power ... the latter hold it from.a position of pain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter discusses empowerment over oneself. The kind of empowerment that enables a person to be whole and independent and loved. It is noted, this has nothing to do with power of others.</p>
<p>By placing pain and power on a continuum, opposite each other, the author is positing that without power we feel psychic pain and as we move towards expressing more personal power we feel less pain. It is also a navigational chart, the goal for the reader is to always be moving towards a place of higher personal empowerment. It is suggested to the reader to create a large diagram of &quot;Pain &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Power&quot; and to mark daily where on the chart the reader falls.</p>
<p>The author offers a chart of pain to power vocabulary, to help readers intellectualize things wit the right perspective:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Pain</th>
<th>Power</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td>I can&#39;t</td>
<td>I won&#39;t</td>

<tr>
<td>I should</td>
<td>I could</td>

<td>It&#39;s not my fault</td>
<td>I am totally responsible</td>

<p>It is argued that the vocabulary used sends messages to the subconscious; messages of power or messages of weakness. It&#39;s important to prime the mind with empowering messages.</p>

<p>As long as you are taking those risks – no matter how small – you are moving yourself to the right on the Pain-to-Power Chart.</p>
