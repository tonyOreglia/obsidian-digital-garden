<p>Great script and acting. Only problem was the main characters akwardk flirting as hit man / true self; it wasn&#39;t clear what was going on there and made for awkward viewing in some scenes. If that was done better, then closer to a 4 rating. Overall enjoyable though, very funny scenes and clever screenplay.</p>
