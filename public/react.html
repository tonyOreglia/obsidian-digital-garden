      <main><h1>React</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>JSX allows you to write HTML directly within Javascript</li>
<li>You can also write JS within JSX by wrapping it in curly brackets <code>{}</code></li>
<li>JSX must actually be transpiled into JS, Babel is often used for this task</li>
<li>JSX code must return one single element</li>
<li>JSX comments should go inside : <code>{/* */}</code></li>
<li>User ReactDOM.render to render React elements to the DOM</li>
<li>JSX uses <code>className</code> instead of <code>class</code> because <code>class</code> is a reserved word in JS</li>
<li>JSX always uses camel case, e.g. <code>onClick</code> and <code>onChange</code></li>
<li>Any JSX element can be written with self closing tags (include <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>Everything in React is a component<ul>
<li>Components can be created as a JS function</li>
<li>React fxn name must start with capital letter</li>
<li>Components can be created with ES6 class syntax by extending the React.Component class<ul>
<li>contain a constructor which calls <code>super()</code>. <code>super()</code> calls the parent class constructor.</li>
<li>Usually <code>props</code> are passed to the constructor and <code>super()</code> method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>React componentscan be composed together; like building blocks</li>
<li><em>children</em> components can be rendered from a <em>parent</em> component</li>
<li><code>ReactDOM.render()</code> can also render components (not just JSX elements)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>props<ul>
<li>props can be passed to components as HTML attributes</li>
<li>default props can be set using the class propery, <code>defaultProps</code></li>
<li>propTypes can be used to type check incoming props</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State<ul>
<li>State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time</li>
<li>You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary</li>
<li>Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props</li>
<li>always use this.setState() when state changes occur</li>
<li>always pass state / props into setState method to make sure it&#39;s working with the latest values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>React can control the internal state for certain elements like <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code></li>
<li><strong>complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React&#39;s key principles.</strong></li>
<li>You can also pass handler functions or any method that&#39;s defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components.</li>
<li>Lifecycle methods / hooks<ul>
<li><code>componentDidMount()</code> – good place to add API calls and even listeners</li>
<li><code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code>  – stop unecessary re-rendering when new state/props passed in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can apply inline styles in JSX as an object with properties in camelCase, e.g.</li>
<li>CSS can be conditionally rendered in React by modifying the styles object under some condition only</li>
<li>server side rendering of react can be helpful for search engine optimization. Also it&#39;s faster to render.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML DOM
 ~ Document Object Model created by the browser when a page is loaded. The DOM is a tree of objects with the Root element <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> at the base of the tree. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp</a></p>
<p>stateful component
 ~ a class component that does maintain its own internal state</p>
<p>stateless component
 ~ a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state</p>
<p>unidirectional data flow
 ~ State flows in one direction down the tree of your application&#39;s components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need.</p>
