<li>kind of turtled, knees on the floor, getting opponent hips on top of my legs by grabbing belt to lift</li>
<li>use the hip hold opponent&#39;s weight sideways and reach up from opponent&#39;s hip to grab opposite side collar</li>
<li>then put chin close to hand right away (important)</li>
<li>then apply pressure, be up on the toes</li>
<li>keep forcing the hips up, bring knee up to staple the arm to the floor with knee</li>
<li>as you staple the arm, you can shrug the leg off the head</li>
<li>then you can drop the hips and spin behind the head (north/south position)</li>
