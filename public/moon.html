<p>Really well acted. Thoughfully written. What makes us invdividuals? The clones after three years have diverged in skills. The different perspectives drive completely different emotional reactions from the same personality. It shows how quickly we diverge with the complexity of our environment. It asks questions of consciousness. It asks questions relevant at any time about the morality of capitalistic domination, for example the crushing child labor used to source minerals used in phones. Very enjoyable movie.</p>
