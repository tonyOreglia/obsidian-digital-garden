<li>Independence: ignore the crowd, focus on the process</li>
<li>Preparation: The only way to win is work, work, work, work</li>
<li>Intellectual humility: knowing and staying with the circle of competence</li>
<li>Analytical rigor: scientific method and use of effective checklists</li>
<li>Allocation: proper allocation is the investors entire job</li>
