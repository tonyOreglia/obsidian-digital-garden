      <main><h1>How to be a Demanding Reader</h1>
<p>There are four questions an *active *reader should have in mind. Answering these questions is the readers job.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the book about as a whole?</li>
<li>What is being said in detail, and how?</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or part?</li>
<li>What of it?</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Make a Book Your Own</p>
<ol>
<li>Underline</li>
<li>Vertical lines at the margin</li>
<li>Star, asterisk, or other doodad at the margin â€“ use sparingly for most important passages of the book.</li>
<li>Numbers in the margin</li>
<li>Numbers of other pages in the margin</li>
<li>Circling of key words or phrases</li>
<li>Writing in the margin, or at the top or bottom of the page</li>
</ol>
