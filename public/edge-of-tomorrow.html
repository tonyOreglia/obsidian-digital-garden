<p>Watched this on a flight. I didn&#39;t expect it to be that great but it&#39;s really a great movie. The acting and chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is believable, funny and you want them together. The plot fits together despite some really tricky storylines; they manage to pull the viewer along without any awkwardness, confusion, or obvious contradictions. The action builds well and the climax is a awesome. the resolution leaves you pretty damn content with the whole thing. I liked the move a lot.</p>
