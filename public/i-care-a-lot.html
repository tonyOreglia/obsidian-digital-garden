<p>This movie will make you angry. Uncomfortably angry; like wanting to punch the screen. Some really fun to watch acting from all the leads. Some of the twists were hard to swallow; as in incredibly unlikely. But overall enjoyable to watch, not predictable, and some good action. The protagonists moral journey puts on display incredible perseverance and selfishness with an absolute absence of social conscience; a hero to hate.</p>
