<blockquote>
<p>The most popular JavaScript tool of all time.</p>

<ul>
<li>All jQuery functions start with a <code>$</code></li>
<li>Typically, you target an HTML element with a <em>selector</em><ul>
<li>for example```
$(&quot;button&quot;).addClass(&quot;animated bounce&quot;);</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>* Simlarly, `removeClass` function removes a class from the target elements
* Elements can be targetted by type, class, or ID
* jQuery has a function called `.css()` that allows you to change the CSS of an element
* jQuery has a function called `.prop()` that allows you to adjust the properties of elements
* jQuery has a function called `.html()` that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element
* jQuery has a function called `.remove()` that will remove an HTML element entirely
* jQuery has a function called `appendTo()` that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element
* jQuery has a function called `clone()` that makes a copy of an element
* jQuery has a function called `parent()` that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you&#39;ve selected
* jQuery has a function called `children()` that allows you to access the children of whichever element you&#39;ve selected
* The `target:nth-child(n)` CSS selector allows you to select all the *nth* elements with the target class or element type
* use `:odd`, `:even`, or `nth-child()` selectors to target specific elements in another way
