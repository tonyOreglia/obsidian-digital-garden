      <main><h1>Steak Marinade</h1>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
<li>½ cup olive oil</li>
<li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic powder</li>
<li>3 tablespoons dried basil</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons dried parsley flakes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
<li>Can also add hot sauce and/or dried minced garlic</li>
</ul>
<h1>What to do</h1>
<p>Blend it. Put it with the meat. Refrigerate up to 8 hours.</p>
<h1>Cooking on Stove Top</h1>
<p>The steak should be cooked about 4 minutes per side on medium high heat. Make sure the pan is hot before cooking. Don&#39;t drip too much marinade into the pan as it will cool it down; also you want to sear the steak, not boil it.</p>
<h1>Miscellaneous Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t use too much lemon juice, just a bit to add some zest and cut the fat.</li>
</ul>
