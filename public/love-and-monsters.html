<p>This movie is awesome. It&#39;s a lot of fun to watch. It kind of has like a Deadpool vibe. It&#39;s silly but you still enjoy the tension and action scenes; and it&#39;s not so silly that the relationships don&#39;t matter. Dylan O&#39;Brien&#39;s acting is great and really funny. The CGI is really cool; crazy monsters of all sorts.</p>
