      <main><h1>Analytical Reading</h1>
<p>Analytical reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given unlimited time. It is intensely active. It is done for the sake of <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<p>Analytical reading requires nine distinct skills or rules:</p>
<h1>The First Stage of Analytical Reading</h1>
<h2>Finding Out What a Book is About</h2>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-1.html">Analytical Reading Rule 1</a></h3>
<p><strong>YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.</strong></p>
<p>Use the title as an initial important hint.</p>
<p>An <strong>expository work</strong> is intended to share knowledge. Theoretical and practical works are expository.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical</strong> works regard something to be seen or understood. 
History, science and philosophy are the three classifications of theoretical work. If a theoretical work pertains to things outside your own experience it is likely a scientific work. Otherwise it is likely philosophical. History is typically in narrative form.</p>
<p><strong>Practical</strong> works tell the reader what one should do or how one should do it.</p>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-2.html">Analytical Reading Rule 2</a></h3>
<p><strong>STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH)</strong></p>
<p>In other words, find the theme or main point of the book.</p>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-3.html">Analytical Reading Rule 3</a></h3>
<p><strong>SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A book is like a single house. It is a mansion having many rooms, rooms on different levels, of different sizes and shapes, with different outlooks, with different uses. The rooms are independent, in part. Each has its own structure and interior decoration. But they are not absolutely independent and separate. They are connected by doors and arches, by corridors and stairways ... as houses are more or less livable, so books are more or less readable. The best books are the ones that have the most intelligible structure.&quot; (pg. 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-4.html">Analytical Reading Rule 4</a></h3>
<p><strong>FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR&#39;S PROBLEMS WERE</strong></p>
<p>This pertains to stating the primary and secondary questions the author sets out to answer. Questions may be practical or theoretical questions.</p>
<h1>The Second Stage of Analytical Reading</h1>
<h2>Finding Out What a Book Says and Interpreting its Contents. What is being said in detail and how.</h2>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-5.html">Analytical Reading Rule 5</a></h3>
<p><strong>FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR</strong></p>
<p>term
 ~ the basic element of communicable knowledge. It is an unambiguous word.</p>
<p>This rule is only applicable to expository works.</p>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-6.html">Analytical Reading Rule 6</a></h3>
<p><strong>MARK THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN</strong></p>
<p>proposition
 ~ an expression of the author&#39;s judgment about something.</p>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-7.html">Analytical Reading Rule 7</a></h3>
<p><strong>LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT TH BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES</strong></p>
<p>Stated differently</p>
<p><strong>FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE IT&#39;S IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT.</strong></p>
<p>One tactic for identifying the main arguments is to first identify the conclusion and work backwards.</p>
<h3><a href="analytical-reading-rule-8.html">Analytical Reading Rule 8</a></h3>
<p><strong>FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHORS SOLUTIONS ARE</strong></p>
<p>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.</p>
<p>Three helpful tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the conclusion and work backwards to the arguments.</li>
<li>Make sure to make a mental note regarding wether an argument is deductive or inductive</li>
<li>Make a note of what the author says they must assume, what can be proved, and what is &quot;self evident&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Third Stage of Analytical Reading</h1>
<h2>Judging the content</h2>
<h3><a href="criticizing-a-book-fairly.html">Criticizing a Book Fairly</a></h3>
<p>The activity of reading does not stop once you&#39;ve understood the book. It must be followed up with fairly weigh and consider the content.</p>
