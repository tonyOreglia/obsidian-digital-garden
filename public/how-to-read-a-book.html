      <main><h1>How to Read a Book</h1>
<p>&quot;<a href="how-to-read-a-book.html">How to Read a Book</a>&quot; is an expository work written by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren. It was first published in 1940.</p>
<p>It is a practical guide on the art of reading for the purpose of increased understanding.</p>
<p>The Art of Reading:
 ~ the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading. (pg. 8)</p>
