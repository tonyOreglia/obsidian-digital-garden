<p>Not sure I understand the name. The vibe of the movie somehow reminded me of Blade Runner, in terms of the speed and certain details (it was not sci-fi, or visually dark or anything).</p>
<p>Benicio del Toro is always entertaining to watch. I like the movie because it is unique in how it highlights and presents characters and information; this alone I found intriguing. The action and plot unfolds nicely and makes sense. Nothing jaw dropping, but a solid, entertaining move.</p>
