<p>Such a cool documentary! It&#39;s 100% real footage and recorded audio from the actual launch and journey to the moon and back. It is all spliced together in a way that captivates and really brings you back to the day. It&#39;s emotional to be brought back to the day on which so many hopes and dreams of effort were in the balance. Knowing how the story ends doesn&#39;t matter. It really reminds you of how amazing it is the progress that has been made on the technological front in the last century. This is a documentary I would recommend; and if you love space flight - a can&#39;t miss.</p>
