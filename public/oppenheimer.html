<p>Oppenheimer wasn&#39;t as good as the hype I think. I found the movie to be average, and the length made that a bit tedious. Of course, the topic itself makes up for a lot and makes the movie more watchable. I though Cillian was very strong, but in the way that you never think about it. Not a striking performance as I saw it. Robert Downey Jr. was quite entertaining, and I thought his role was played very well, especially in revealing the resentment towards Oppenheimer in the end.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&#39;t like is how dumbed down the technical discussions were. It should be ok for the audience to not understand everything the worlds smartest people are saying. Some of the scenes were the people are meant to be looking smart (and making the audience feel smart because they understand) were so dumbed down it&#39;s a bit cringey; like when they spare 8 seconds for a scientist to realize the potential for black holes by exclaiming. &quot;if the gravity increases as the star shrinks .... nothing could escape&quot;; yes, nice epoch making breakthrough random guy holding chalk; but Cillian looked at him with eyebrows furrowed, what he said must have been really intelligent.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know about the history of Oppenheimer&#39;s involvement and subsequent political drama. That was all interesting. Also for someone that didn&#39;t live through the Cold War it&#39;s cool to understand more of the tone mood around nuclear weapons in that era.</p>
