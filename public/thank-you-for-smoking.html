<p>Overall, I liked the movie. I absolutely recommend it for what it reveals.</p>
<p>It did a good job of exposing how ludicrous corporate lobbyism can be. I really liked how it put on display the sophism and distractionism used to influence the public. The son / father discussions around persuasion are a great way to explain these tactics. I also appreciated how the movie demonstrated the limitations of modern media (television specifically) on real discourse; how a nice soundbite wins the audience between commercials regardless and no time is left for substantive debate.</p>
<p>In terms of pure entertainment though, I didn&#39;t like the acting; somehow the whole thing seem contrived; maybe that element was deliberate but I found it distracting. I get that the dialogue had a purpose rather than just telling a story but the dialogue just comes off unnatural in many scenes.</p>
