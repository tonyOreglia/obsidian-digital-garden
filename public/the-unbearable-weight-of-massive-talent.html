<p>This movie is awesome. The title sets the tone. It&#39;s a very creative script which I think demanded a lot of versatility from the actors which they nailed. The story is that Nick Cage, playing himself, meets a friend Javi (played by Pedro Pascal) who wants to write a movie. They start to write a movie together. Slowly the movie they are writing and the drama they are living in converges into the same. The final scene is playing by different actors which is the full transition into the movie Nick and his friend made. The overt plot is of friendship, family life and difficulties, and having correct priorities. It&#39;s interesting as they include heroism, action, risk, explosions, and tension but all in a self mocking way as you see Nick and Javi discussing the need for these things in a Blockbuster movie.</p>
