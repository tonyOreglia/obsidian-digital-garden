<p>A solid movie. Good storyline. A great, seemingly authentic peak into India without making that the focus of the movie. Seems timely in terms of progress in India away from the ultra rigid caste system. It&#39;s the story of a servant whose ambitions grow beyond his caste and circumstances bring him to a crossroads. Well acted. But a little bit too long for me considering that not a whole lot of things happen; found my attention waning at times.</p>
