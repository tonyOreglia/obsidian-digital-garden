      <main><h1>Remember: The Children on Charlie</h1>
<ul>
<li>Respect people&#39;s generosity and time. If someone helps you, make sure they don&#39;t regret it. When you borrow a man&#39;s car, always return it with a full tank.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also a key to making and maintaining friendships</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlie reads like crazy, in his favorite chair.</li>
<li>ability to block out distractions and focus intensely, without apology</li>
<li>be skeptical, even to the point of contrarianism</li>
</ul>
