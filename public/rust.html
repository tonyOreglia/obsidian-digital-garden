<pre><code>* there is an automatic formatter tool called rustfmt to format your code in a particular style
* Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab
* using a ! means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function
* end rust lines with a semicolon

# Hello, Cargo!

* Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.

## Cargo.toml

* [package], is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a package
* [dependencies], is the start of a section for you to list any of your project’s dependencies
* In Rust, packages of code are referred to as *crates*
* `cargo check` checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable
* `cargo build` to build a program
* `cargo run` to build and run a program

# Programming a Guessing Game

* `let` statement to create the variable
* To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name
* `String::new` is a function that returns a new instance of a `String` type
* use `&amp;` to pass by reference
* use `&amp;mut` to pass by reference and have it be mutable
* The `Result` types are enumerations, often referred to as *enums*, which can have a fixed set of possibilities known as *variants*
    * nums are often used with match, a conditional that makes it convenient to execute different code based on which variant an enum value is when the conditional is evaluated.
    * `Result` type is for error handling
    * `Result` can be variants are `Ok` or `Err`
* when printing use `{}` as a placeholder for a variable, this is for any type (apparently)
* running the cargo doc –open command will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser
* use `cmp` to compare any comparable value. It&#39;s a method to be called on a value, and it takes a reference to another value as argument
* there are `match` expressions which has `arms`. Each `arm` is a possible value (like a switch statement), along with the code to run if that is the case

# Common Programming Concepts

## Variables and Mutability

* be default rust variables are immutable
* use the `mut` keyword to make an immutable var
* use the `const` keyword to make a const 
    * can be declared in global scope
    * limited operations possible at compile time for assigning values to const&#39;
    * always immutable
* variables can be shadowed, in which case the type can also change (not so with mutable variables)
    * shadowed variable only holds new value in current scope

## Data Types

* Four Scalar types – single value
    1. integer
    1. floating-point
    1. Boolean
    1. character
