      <main><h1>Inspectional Reading</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>When reading at this level, the student is allowed a set time to complete an assigned amount of reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This level of reading answers the question, &quot;what is the book about?&quot; and &quot;what is the structure of the book?&quot;.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of inspections reading</p>
<h3>PreReading:</h3>
<p>This is the first subtype of inspectional reading which is the second level of reading according to How To Read a Book.</p>
<p>Steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the title page and the preface (if there is one). Use this information to shed light on the subject of the book and genre.</li>
<li>Study the table of contents to get a sense of the books structure.</li>
<li>Check the index to get a feel for the range of topics and perhaps looks up some of the passages cited.</li>
<li>Read the publishers blurb</li>
<li><strong>Look now at the chapters that seem pivotal to the argument.</strong></li>
<li>Dip through the book reading a chapter or page here and there. <strong>Do not fail to read the last couple page or so.</strong> Often times the author will summarize and discuss the larger importance of the issue or implications.</li>
