      <main><h1>Analytical Reading Rule 8</h1>
<p><strong>FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHORS SOLUTIONS ARE</strong></p>
<p>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.</p>
<p>Three helpful tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the conclusion and work backwards to the arguments.</li>
<li>Make sure to make a mental note regarding wether an argument is deductive or inductive</li>
<li>Make a note of what the author says they must assume, what can be proved, and what is &quot;self evident&quot;</li>
</ol>
