<p>This movie made me feel uneasy. The whole vibe was slightly disturbing. The build up is kine of a slow burn and feeling uneasy for over an hour was not very enjoyable, but I think it was worthwhile once the tension broke. Ultimately, I realized the awkward dialogue and pauses were all part of setting the tone; and getting into the shoes of the protagonist. I liked this movie, overall.</p>
