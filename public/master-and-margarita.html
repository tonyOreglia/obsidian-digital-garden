      <main><h1>Master and Margarita</h1>
<p>A strange tale set in Russia. It&#39;s novel in which the devil is a real character, he and his band of misfits visit Moscow and reap chaos.</p>
<p>A few people end up in the mental asylum, some in jail, others vanished completely, and some were spiritied out of the country; two building burned down; and a very confused police force.</p>
<p>Only &quot;the master&quot; and his love are able to somehow find a good bargain. This relationship is putting on display the power of love to trump evil.</p>
<p>There are also some insights into the Russian society at that time, for example a long sequence around the prohibition of foreign money.</p>
