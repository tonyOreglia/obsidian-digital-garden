<p>This movie came around for me. It&#39;s a bit slow in the development of some scenes. In the first half I was a bit confused as to who was who and why people were doing what they were doing and why some characters had masks and and so forth. I wasn&#39;t convinced any of this was going to be explained and that I was just failing miserably to follow the plot. However, as the story went on it came together and everything was tied together by the end. It was actually a really great story. I think the directory did a great job of allowing the story to develop at it&#39;s own pace; not being purposely obtuse nor holding the viewers hand through every detail. I enjoyed the movie; it&#39;s fun. There are some great classic Western scenes.</p>
