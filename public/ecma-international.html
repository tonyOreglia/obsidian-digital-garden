<p>An organization that creates standards for technologies.</p>
<p>Ecma International is responsible for several standards. One of which is ECMA-262 whic is the ECMAScript Language Specification (based on JavaScript).</p>
<p>Ecma is a standards organization for information and communication systems.[1] It acquired its current name in 1994, when the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) changed its name to reflect the organization&#39;s global reach and activities. As a consequence, the name is no longer considered an acronym and no longer uses full capitalization.</p>
<p>The organization was founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe.</p>
