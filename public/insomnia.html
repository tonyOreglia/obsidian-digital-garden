</ul>
<p>An entertaining thriller. It doesn&#39;t satisfy for those looking for a deep crazy psychological thriller â€“ there is nothing particularly fascinating on that front. Robin Williams is a convincing psychopath but Al Pacino kind of just seems like Al Pacino as a detective. I don&#39;t even find him particularly convincing in terms of being low on sleep. But the storyline is consistent and it draws you along and keep you entertained through the end. There is just nothing particularly unique in this movie. It just delivers what is promised, despite a superstar cast suggests something more.</p>
