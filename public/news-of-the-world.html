<p>Solid, entertaining movie. You don&#39;t have to think much. It takes it&#39;s time without getting boring. Great acting by both Hanks but particularly Zengel, I thought. Some of the scenes seemed unlikely which I don&#39;t like much in a realistic fiction.  As a western or period piece it&#39;s kind of interesting but I&#39;m not convinced it is particularly rigid in historical accuracy. However, realism and historical accuracy are clearly not the aim of this movie. It seems to follow a classic storyline of the heroes journey, through territory and challenges while grappling with some inner problem, a final test that is overcome. There are some very heavy symbolic parallels being worked out; two broken people reaching a compromising unity just as the nation recently split in the civil war is contemplating unity; and at a time when the actual nation is as divided as ever.</p>
