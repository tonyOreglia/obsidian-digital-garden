<p>I really enjoyed this film.  It is a remake of the French 2011 film The Intouchables; which is an another great movie. With remakes though, you never know. It can be hard to re-capture the same magic; but this film really does it. The dynamic between the characters is really authentic and fun to watch. The acting never seems forced. Actually, I think Kevin Hart really shows how far he&#39;s come as a serious actor in this film. The story is great; and actually I didn&#39;t remember the details from the original so I was surprised how the story resolved. It a classic tale of someone overcoming their inner struggles. Two unlikely characters helping each other in ways that neither suspects at first. Entertaining, hilarious at times and heartfelt.</p>
