<p>Actually didn&#39;t finish; because we were so bored so maybe not qualified to give a review but... Completely gave up on following the stupidly complex narrative whose setup consists of endless speed conversations with shitty dialogue and a log of nonsense. Stopped watching because at that point it&#39;s the same as going on youtube to see explosions and shooting.</p>
