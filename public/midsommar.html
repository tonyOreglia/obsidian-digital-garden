<p>Crazy movie. The central plot is actually that of a failing relationship. The relationship dynamic and characters are believable. The dialogue is sensical and realistic. I really like the writing for this reason. Around this simple plot is a super crazy ancient nordic planting season festival. The festival cleverly plays in to the progression of the failing relationship and there is a sense that the whole thing is a metaphor for the stages of a failing relationship. It&#39;s gruesome and scary and fun. Great movie.</p>
