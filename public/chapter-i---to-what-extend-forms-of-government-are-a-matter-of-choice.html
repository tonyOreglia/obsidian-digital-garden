      <main><h1>Chapter I - To What Extend Forms of Government are a Matter of Choice</h1>
<p>This chapter tries to find to what extent a form of government can be devised or chosen by a particular people for themselves; and if there is some possibility there, what are it&#39;s limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mill posits that there are two popular opinions on this question <ol>
<li>government is purely an invention which can be devised or chosen by a people to be applied</li>
<li>government is like an organic growth; it&#39;s form is inevitable for a given people / context and cannot be chosen</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Mill finds it self evident that the truth is somewhere between the two</li>
<li>There are some obstacles that may make a particular form of government untenable<ol>
<li>Repugnance of the people towards a particular form of government</li>
<li>A people unwilling or unable to fulfill the necessary conditions<ul>
<li>may be due to laziness, cowardice or lack of patriotism</li>
<li>unwilling to fight for it; when attacked</li>
<li>able to be deluded easily; or convinced to hand over liberties to some individual</li>
<li>unwilling to leave vengeance to he law – results in a necessarily despotic government</li>
<li>people more likely to shelter a criminal then to testify against; or whose sympathies are not on the side of the law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mechanical difficulties may also make a form of government impossible by disrupting tax collection or law enforcement</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Kindling a desire in people for a particular form a government is a necessary step in forming a new order</li>
<li>Some claim that the existing power dynamics pre-determine the order of a nation – however, Mill argues that power is actually primarily gained through government itself.</li>
<li>Beliefs can disrupt physical and economic power</li>
<li>Mill concludes that the form of government is a result of rational choice on the part of it&#39;s people</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some great quotes form this chapter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It [government] needs, not their simple acquiescence, but their active participation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To inquire into the best form of government in the abstract is not a chimerical, but a highly practical employment of scientific intellect</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In politics, as in mechanics, the power which is to keep the engine going must be sought for outside the machinery</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One person with a belief is a social power equal to ninety-nine who have only interests.</p>
