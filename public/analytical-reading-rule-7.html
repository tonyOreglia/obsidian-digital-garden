      <main><h1>Analytical Reading Rule 7</h1>
<p><strong>LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT TH BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES</strong></p>
<p>Stated differently</p>
<p><strong>FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE IT&#39;S IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT.</strong></p>
<p>One tactic for identifying the main arguments is to first identify the conclusion and work backwards.</p>
