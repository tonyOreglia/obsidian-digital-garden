      <main><h1>Talk 5 - The Need for More Multidisciplinary Skills from Professionals - Educational Implications</h1>
<p>Given at Harvard Law School on 24th Apr 1998</p>
<p>Charlie attempts to answer five questions</p>
<h1>Five Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do professionals dealing with broadscale problems need more multidisciplinary skill?</li>
<li>Is education today multidisciplinary enough?</li>
<li>In soft science, what is the best approach to multidisciplinary education?</li>
<li>What has been the progress in the last 50 years?</li>
<li>How can things be moved along faster?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Question 1 and 2: is more multidisciplinary skill needed?</h2>
<p>To answer this, we should ask</p>
<ol>
<li>will more multidisciplinary improve bad thinking?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Multidisciplary <a href="mental-models.html">mental models</a> approach</p>
<ul>
<li>avoids the <a href="man-with-a-hammer-syndrome.html">man with a hammer syndrome</a></li>
<li>avoids bias that serves the subject more than the application of the subject</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>what causes bad thinking in the first place? <ul>
<li>education is too undisciplined</li>
<li>education is too divided</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Question 3: what is now the goal?</h2>
<h3>Follow the pilot&#39;s training approach</h3>
<ol>
<li>wide formal educations</li>
<li>practice-based fluency of core material</li>
<li>forward and backward thinking trained</li>
<li>training emphasized by measure of importance</li>
<li>checklist routines mandatory</li>
<li>continuous maintenance to avoid atrophy</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>we need ... to have multidisciplinary coverage of immense amplitude, with <strong>all needed skills</strong> raised to an ever-maintained practice-based fluency, including considerable power of synthesis at boundaries between disciplines, with the highest fluency levels being achieved where they are most needed, with forward and reverse thinking techniques being employed in a manner reminding one of inversion in algebra, and with &quot;checklist&quot; routines being a permanent part of the knowledge system</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All <a href="mental-models.html">mental models</a> should focus on the fundamental big ideas in each subject. They carry most of the weight and are generally not too difficult to grasp.</li>
</ul>
<p>fundamental ideas are more useful generally than narrow expertise.</p>
<h2>Question 4: Considering the pilot program approach, how much has elite soft-science education improved in recent years?</h2>
<p>yes, but there is still much to be done. Essentially, they&#39;ve implemented an open sharing culture which is good is inefficient and, in some cases, counter-productive.</p>
<p>Ok so what should be done?</p>
<ol>
<li>more courses outside the primary focus should be mandatory</li>
<li>there should be much more practical problem solving</li>
<li>increase the use of business periodicals like Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, etc.</li>
<li>avoid professors with passionate ideology</li>
<li>soft science should imitate the organizational ethos of hard science:<ul>
<li>prefer more fundamental disciplines</li>
<li>master and practice regularly the essentials of the four hard sciences</li>
<li>prefer the most fundamental concepts in any explanation; and attribute the explanation appropriately</li>
<li>create new principles, and prove old ones wrong when evidence suggest it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The happier mental realm I recommend is one from which no one willingly returns. A return would be like cutting off one&#39;s hands.</p>
