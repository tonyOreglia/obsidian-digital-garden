<p>This is a classic; I could really remember first seeing the previews of the kung fu in the trees when I was ten years old. So I was excited to re-watch this and see how the special effects and everything aged. The fight scenes are pure fun; they are unique, imaginative and just really well done. It kind of feels like watching the Jedi&#39;s of Star Wars battle. Somehow the movie doesn&#39;t seem to take itself to seriously; in a good way. The characters are interesting and quirky in way that&#39;s not afraid to be sort of laughed at.</p>
<p>The story takes a little effort to follow due to the subtitles; but it&#39;s a great romance with a happy ending. I had no problem getting engrossed in the characters journeys and empathizing with them. Overall; a move I would recommend.</p>
