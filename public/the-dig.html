<p>Not my cup of tea. But, for someone that very much enjoys period pieces and and subtle drama; it&#39;s a quality movie, well made, thoughtful, with good acting. It&#39;s really like a history piece of history itself in the making; or unearthing / finding. For me it was a bit slow, the contextual history (WWII) wasn&#39;t such that there was a lot to learn there. The drama was actually poignant but somehow underwhelming; maybe, during Covid quarantine, I am just in the mood for a something with more escapism.</p>
