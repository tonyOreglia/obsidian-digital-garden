      <main><h1>ideology</h1>
<p>Ideology will distort thinking where reality disagrees with the ideas</p>
<blockquote>
<p>being totally sure on issues like that with a strong, violent ideology, in my opinion, turns you into a lousy thinker</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what I&#39;m against is being very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that your particular intervention will do more good than hard, given that you&#39;re dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is interacting with everything else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>even highly credentialed experts can be extremely biased by ideology and we must have the confidence to challenge that type of thinking regardless of the source.</p>
<p>Extreme ideology leads to poor thinking.</p>
