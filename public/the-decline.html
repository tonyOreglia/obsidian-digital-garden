<p>Awesome French film about a group of survival enthusiasts (people convinced of some impending cataclysm and subsequent global resource shortage) that sign up for a weeklong survival training course with some Youtube guy they all follow. It&#39;s at his survival bunker deep in the middle of nowhere. It&#39;s all good until it&#39;s not. A lot of fun to watch.</p>
