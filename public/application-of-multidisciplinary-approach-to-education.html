      <main><h1>Application of multidisciplinary approach to education</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>we need ... to have multidisciplinary coverage of immense amplitude, with <strong>all needed skills</strong> raised to an ever-maintained practice-based fluency, including considerable power of synthesis at boundaries between disciplines, with the highest fluency levels being achieved where they are most needed, with forward and reverse thinking techniques being employed in a manner reminding one of inversion in algebra, and with &quot;checklist&quot; routines being a permanent part of the knowledge system</p>
