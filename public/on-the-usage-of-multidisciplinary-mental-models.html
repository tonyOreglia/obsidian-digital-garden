      <main><h1>On the usage of multidisciplinary mental models</h1>
<ul>
<li>facts are not enough, you need models which is the structure facts hang off.</li>
<li>you need many models, otherwise you&#39;ll see everything through the narrow lense of a single pattern</li>
<li>models are effective ways to understand aspects of complex systems<ul>
<li>therefore models should come from a variety of disciplines, to capture more aspects of the whole interconnected complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a minority of models will carry the majority of weight. 80/20 rule.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>learn the fundamental ideas in each major discipline, always prefer the explanation that uses more fundamental ideas â€“&gt; use the checklist style for these fundamental ideas</p>
<hr>
<p>use a big bag of multidisciplinary tricks, mastered to fluency, applied to all complex problems in life</p>
