<ul>
<li>the opponent pushing off your chest is not a move seen at the higher level</li>
<li>a good opponent will keep the arms locked and close to the chest</li>
<li>you need to get the elbow inside the hips<ol>
<li>get a good cross face, grab under the rear deltoid</li>
<li>walk the arm out and up</li>
<li>eventually trap that arm with the head</li>
<li>bring both arms under the head</li>
<li>bring the knee up to your own elbow. This knee wedges the shoulder</li>
<li>other leg comes around to under the far shoulder</li>
<li>now the arms have released the head, the leg side arm is hooking the arm hook elbow to elbow</li>
<li>touch ear to opponents thigh so the near leg can go over the opponent&#39;s head</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>do not sit down until the leg is over the opponent&#39;s head</li>
<li>you want to get the opponents forearm across the chest, before leaning back</li>
<li>make sure to secure the elbow at the hip</li>
<li>two on one once the arm is extended</li>
<li>can bring the feet together near his ear to raise the fulcrim point</li>
<li>one arm pushes and one pulls to get the tap</li>
</ul>
