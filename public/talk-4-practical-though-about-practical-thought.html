      <main><h1>Talk 4: Practical Though about Practical Thought?</h1>
<p>Informal talk given on 20th Jul 1996</p>
<p>In this talk, Charlie applies five <em>notions</em> to solve a complex problem. The problem is to build coca-cola to it&#39;s present success from a small seed fund.</p>
<h1>Notions</h1>
<ol>
<li>simplify problems by deciding on the big no-brainer questions first</li>
<li>apply the language of math to the problem</li>
<li>think through the problem in reverse</li>
<li>utilize <a href="mental-models.html">mental models</a> from elementary academic wisdom from multiple disciplines</li>
<li><a href="lollapalooza.html">lollapalooza</a> effects come from a combination of factors acting in the same direction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Charlie concludes by highlighting a few things<ul>
<li>academia is largely ignorant of psychology, and not synthesized across domains well enough</li>
<li>psychology departments are low quality in general</li>
<li>a darwinian approach to academics; i.e. always attempting to disprove oneself; will lead to academia solving it&#39;s shortcomings eventually</li>
</ul>
</li>
