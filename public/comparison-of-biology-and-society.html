      <main><h1>Comparison of Biology and Society</h1>
<p>How many parallels can be drawn between the modern industrial societies electrical / plumbing grid and biologies nervous/vascular systems? Look at the modern cities vast complex network of electricity and fluids flowing into it, through it (and eventually out of it). Like so many networks of the nervous system, vascular system (and digestive tract). The blood flowing to cells, which take in the fresh and send out the bad, like so many homes. Each cell and home have individual systems within responsible for specific tasks.</p>
