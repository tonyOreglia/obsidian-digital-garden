<p>This movie is fast paced and somewhat overwhelming. But you don&#39;t realize until you digest it for a moment after that it&#39;s foundation is solid; the chaos is built around a solid philosophy or world view which seems true through the lense of the film.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a move about chance, but in a weird way it&#39;s pointing out how chance does not direct our lives, other people do.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about the role of men in society. Men have the power to destroy, to protect, to forgive. Damaged men damage others. Strong men provide structure and can heal others.</p>
<p>The move points out that although chance plays a role in our lives; and our destiny is truly not in our control; it is in the control of other humans. Our lives are primarily shaped by the decisions of the people that we interact with in our lives – they can be random acquantances, or family – but these people have the power to build us or break us and they do. The randomness is more about who we cross paths with; rather than what does or doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p>There is a strange scene with frogs pouring down. It is hugely disorienting but we realize that, despite the extreme physical reality of the frogs, they don&#39;t effect the plot meaningfully. I mean, they do, they knock a guy off a ladder – but they don&#39;t change his intention, and in his intention lays the plot.</p>
<p>There are 9 characters I think – </p>
<h1>mysoginist (son of absent father)</h1>
<h1>abusive father</h1>
<h1>absent father</h1>
<h1>cop</h1>
<h1>child of abuser/drug attict</h1>
<h1>wife of abuser</h1>
<h1>child prodigy</h1>
<h1>ambitious father</h1>
<h1>caretaker</h1>
<p>The plot is mainly driven by the male characters that exhibit various impactful roles males end up playing in society. Some are pure evil like the father that abused his daughter. Some are victims that pass on the pain, like the mysoginist whose father was absent. Some are the redeemers, like the cop, who is naive but good intentioned and heals the daughter of the abuser by forgiving her for who she is. He also forgives the child prodigy who became a lost sole.</p>
<p>So the cop is the christ figure, the forgiver and redeemer of society. The caretaker is also a positive figure, but he does not impact, he facilitates some plot line but he does not have a big impact which I think is also a comment on mens role. The redeemer requires some force, some threat, some power, some courage to redeem society – being good is not enough; and I believe that is the central message of this film.</p>
<p>The absentee father, the abusive father, and the ambitious father are the evil which throws society into chaos.</p>
<p>The women play a secondary role in this film as victims or benefactors of the men in their lives.</p>
<p>The 9 characters are all looped together in a ring of relationships.</p>
<p>The movie starts out talking about random unlikely chances ... I don&#39;t know why ... to me this is almost like a false hint to throw the reality in starker clarity ?</p>
