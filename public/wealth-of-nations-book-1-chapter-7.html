<h1>Chapter 7 - Of the Natural and Market Price of Commodities</h1>
<h2>definitions</h2>
<p>natural Price
 ~ when price of commodity perfectly covers the rent, wages and profits needed to produce it.</p>
<p>market price
 ~ the actual price for which any commodity is sold</p>
<p>effectual demand
 ~ demand for commodity at it&#39;s natural price</p>
<ul>
<li>Market prices deviate from natural price in response to supply and demand</li>
<li>monopoly, legislation, trade secrets can all effect supply and demand and thus the market price</li>
<li>changes in market prices fall mainly on wages and profit. Not as much on rent.</li>
