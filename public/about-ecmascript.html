      <main><h1>About ECMAScript</h1>
<p>This is a standard published by Ecma International. It contains the specification for a general purpose scripting language.</p>
<p>ECMAScript provides the rules, details, and guidelines that a scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant.</p>
<p>ECMAScript is a standardized specification of a scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; initially it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.</p>
<p>In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then.</p>
