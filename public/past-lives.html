<p>This movie was fucking great. I watched it on the flight from Lisbon to SÃ£o Paulo.</p>
<p>It was great in that it is true to real life, and it was revelatory in that truth. The truth it exhibits is the fact that the first romantic love between Nora and Hae Sung was not rekindled; which is more often than not the reality of early relationships. The revelation (which is discovered by the audience and Nora together) is the wisdom that their attraction based on the way the relationship broke off. They represent a sharp loss to each other. The solution is not to try and mend what cannot be mended, but to recognize what has ossified and continue with life and growth into new things.</p>
<p>It is also (fucking) great as a classic hero&#39;s journey. The characters grow; they are not the same in the end of the movie; despite the great pain we feel for them as they accept the growth and look away from each other in the final scene.</p>
