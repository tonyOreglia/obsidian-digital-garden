      <main><h1>Analytical Reading Rule 1</h1>
<p><strong>YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.</strong></p>
<p>Use the title as an initial important hint.</p>
<p>An <strong>expository work</strong> is intended to share knowledge. Theoretical and practical works are expository.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical</strong> works regard something to be seen or understood. 
History, science and philosophy are the three classifications of theoretical work. If a theoretical work pertains to things outside your own experience it is likely a scientific work. Otherwise it is likely philosophical. History is typically in narrative form.</p>
<p><strong>Practical</strong> works tell the reader what one should do or how one should do it.</p>
